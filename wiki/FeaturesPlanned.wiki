#summary Planned features for PMix

= Introduction =
PMix is still in early development phase... There are several features we would like to implement.

= Planned features for 0.3 =
  * Update to Android API 1.0 *done by sag*
  * Nicer Artwork (Menu/Buttons on Main Screen) *done by sag*
  * Browse Playlist *partly done by bpo, merge done by sag*
  * Settings with Android API Preferences *done by sag*
  * Release on Android Market (Account opened by sag)
  * Stability! *partly done by sag/bpo*
  * Add Licence notice to source files
  * Choose MPD-Outputs *done by sag*

= Planned features for further releases =
  * Nicer browsing for Artists/Albums (maybe equal to Android Music Player)
  * Add more than one MPD-Server
  * Connect only when WLAN is on (PMix is useless over internet, right?)
  * Type Safety (mainly in JMPDComm) *slubman is working on this*
  * Download Songs to Android (via Context Menu)
  * Save and Load Playlists
  * Slider for letters as in Contacts
  * Consider use tabs instead menus
  * WakeOnLan Settings *sag is working this*
  * Centralize connection management *sag is working this*
  * Option for Random/Repeat mode
  * Menuitem to refresh directory (on MPD) in FSActivity
  * CoverFlow (Maybe, with OpenGL)
  * Support MPD-Output *sag is working this*
  * Avoid creating new objects all the time (saves many cpu cycles => battery lifetime) *sag is working this*
  * Cover caching (check for legal issues)
  * Check for new versions ([http://code.google.com/android/devel/sign-publish.html#market])
