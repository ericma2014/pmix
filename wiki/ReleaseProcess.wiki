#summary Describes how to make a release of PMix
= Release process for pmix =

== First time ==
We have to use a self-signed certificate to sigining the apk files... I generated this key, if you need this ask me (stefan.agner)
{{{
keytool -genkey -v -keystore pmix.keystore -alias pmix -keyalg RSA -validity 10000
}}}
I used this values for the certificate:
{{{
CN=PMix developer, OU=Unknown, O=pmix, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=org
}}}

To change the keypassword, use this command:
{{{
keytool -keypasswd -v -keystore pmix.keystore -alias pmix
}}}

To export the Key (e.g. to transfer to another developer) use this command:
{{{
keytool -exportcert -v -keystore pmix.keystore -alias pmix ...
}}}

== Every release ==
 # Test the application! :-)
 # Check android:versionName and android:versionCode in AndroidManifest.xml
 # Remove android:debuggable="true" from the Element <application> AndroidManifest.xml (if exists)
 # Remove log files, backup files, and other unnecessary files from the application project (not needed normally)
 # Deactivate any calls to Log methods in the source code (I don't did this at my releases)
 # Call "Project" "Clean", just to make sure all is recompiled right...
 # Right Click on the pmix project, choose "Android Tools" and "Export Unsigned Application Package..."
 # Save the File as PMix.apk
 # Sign the apk file with jarsigner -verbose -keystore pmix.keystore PMix.apk pmix
 # Verify the signed apk file with jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs PMix.apk
 # svn copy https://pmix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://pmix.googlecode.com/svn/branches/0.3 --username stefan.agner
